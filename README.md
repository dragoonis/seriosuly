Consistency is always good!

Why do we want non consistent stuffs inside PSR2?

Tab Vs Spaces Debate
====================
I agree I use tabs, but I have always set where should the tab stop in 
`.vimrc`

```bash
set smartindent
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab
```

Please fork it and add a new line with your favourite editor and commit it, 
let us see how it looks now.

Please don't create problems, let us solve it. 

Solution
========
According to your editor settings set `1 tab = 4 spaces`. Use tab/spaces 
hell as heaven.

You are still using tabs, no worries. Editor will convert to spaces. 
You love tabs. You are using it. Let us make consistency and not problems.
